# Networking Exercises  

This repository documents my hands-on exercises in networking, focusing on Packet Tracer, OSI model, cabling, and security configurations.  

## Exercises  

### 1. First Exercise  
In this exercise, I got familiar with the Packet Tracer environment and devices like switches and routers. I implemented a network where two PCs are connected to two servers in another location.  

### 2. Second Exercise  
I learned about different types of network cables, including UTP (both straight-through and crossover) and fiber optic cables. Additionally, I studied the transmitter and receiver pins in PCs, switches, routers, servers, and firewalls.  

### 3 & 4. Third & Fourth Exercises  
These exercises focused on the OSI model. I configured security settings such as setting up passwords and secrets for routers and switches to enhance network security.  

### 5 & 6. Exercises
In this exercise, I have learned how the ping command works. I also learned how to access the MAC table on a switch and clear it.

### 7 & 8. Exercises
In this exercise, I learned about IPv4 address classification, subnets, and assigning IP addresses to a router. I verified the setup using the `ping` command to test connectivity between PCs on different LANs.

### 9. Exercises
I learned how to manually configure the speed and duplex on interfaces connected to other networking devices (not end hosts). I also learned how to configure appropriate descriptions on each interface. Additionally, I learned the importance of disabling interfaces that are not connected to any device for security purposes.
